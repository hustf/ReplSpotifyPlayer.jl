# This file contains functions used internally by repl_player.jl, the user facing functions.
# Some of these wrappers translate into ReplSpotifyPlayer types and DataFrame.
# These are second-tier, not called directly by keypresses, rather indirect.
# They wrap hierarcical functionality in Spotify.jl/library
# They are based on Spotify.jl/example/
